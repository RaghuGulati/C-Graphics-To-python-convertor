# C-Graphics-To-python-convertor
It converts a C graphics code to its equivalent python graphics code in pygame. It basically converts only the shapes functions of
C graphics such as line, circle, drawpoly( for drawing various polygons), ellipse, arcs and rectangele. It can run on Windows and 
linux. 

# Pre-requisites
=> Python version 3 <br>
=> pygame and tkinter packages installed

# Installation
You need to clone the this repository.

For linux use the command git clone <link of the repository> :
git clone https://github.com/RaghuGulati/C-Graphics-To-python-convertor

- for linux, then enter in the folder which is downloaded and you will se the file Convertor.py; 
    To execute, use command "python3 Convertor.py"
    
- for windows, you can execute it on any python IDE such as visual studio, pycharm.

# C++ graphics functions to python graphics
You can type the new code or can open the pre-existing C graphics file and execute it. On execution it will open a window which will display the output of the code (i.e. it will draw the shapes as entered in the code) and a file "Source Code.txt" will be created in which the equivalent python graphics code for corresponding C graphics code will be there.
